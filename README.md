A Unity Project for a puzzle game idea I had.

The game is fairly simple, in each level there is a puzzle in the form of a group of dots (stars). The stars are randomly attached to a number of spinner objects, then each spinner is randomly scrambled. The goal of each puzzle is to rotate these spinners until you form the picture (within a certain amount of tolerance).

There is also a tool to facilitate making and editing puzzles that you can view by selecting Window/Puzzle Editor to view. It allows you to load in an existing puzzle (or start a fresh puzzle), add/remove/recolour the stars of the puzzle and then save out the puzzle, as well as test out your changes to the puzzle without having to save out your changes and view them in the game.

I have a Trello showing things I currently plan on adding/changing here: https://trello.com/b/fhUpXZEt/star-spinner
