A Unity Project for a puzzle game idea I had.

The game is fairly simple, in each level there is a puzzle in the form of a group of dots (stars). The stars are randomly attached to a number of spinner objects, then each spinner is randomly scrambled. The goal of each puzzle is to rotate these spinners until you form the picture (within a certain amount of tolerance).
