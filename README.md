A Unity Project for a puzzle game idea I had.

The game is fairly simple, in each level there is a puzzle in the form of a group of dots (stars). The stars are randomly attached to a number of spinner objects, then each spinner is randomly scrambled. The goal of each puzzle is to rotate these spinners until you form the picture (within a certain amount of tolerance).

There is also a tool to facilitate making and editing puzzles that you can view by selecting Window/Puzzle Editor to view. I am still adding feature to this tool, but it can do all the basic stuff such a tool would be expected to do.

I have a Trello showing things I currently plan on adding/changing here: https://trello.com/b/fhUpXZEt/star-spinner
