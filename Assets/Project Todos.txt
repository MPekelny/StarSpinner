Things left to do for the game:

-- Determine a more full sequence for when a level is won.
--- Currently thinking once a level is determined to be won, play a short particle effect burst along with tweening things into a final state (all spinners rotation be 0 and their spinner objects set not visible, the star's colours to their final color, the puzzle name set and faded in, the back button not visible, and a level end menu showing, allowing the player to return to the level selection or just go to the next level).
-- Add more to the level selection screen. Namely, the screen is set up to allow for 20 levels to be shown at once, so need a previous and next button to go through pages of levels. Also, need to determine how to show that levels have been completed (minimum some sort of highlighting to mark it, maybe something like showing a miniature version of the solved puzzle on the button).
-- Add in save data so that completed levels are still marked as complete on returning to the game and can resume levels that were backed out while in progress in the exact state they were left in.
--- On that note, add in functionality to resume levels.
-- Add in functionality to get hints (which in a final version, players would watch an RV to get that hint, probably once per level). Currently thinking that the hint will be locking one of the spinners into the correct position and visually marking all the stars that are attached to that spinner in some way.
-- The way I have levels being made at the moment is not too bad, but I want to figure out how to make some sort of tool to make it even simpler.
-- Once most or all the other things above are done, make any tweaks to optimize for mobile (namely, making sure all touching feels right and handling multi touching).
-- Do a pass to increase testing coverage.
